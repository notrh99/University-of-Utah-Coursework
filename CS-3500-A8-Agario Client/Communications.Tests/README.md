# Partnership:
Copied from the previous assignment.


Rayyan and I pair programmed on the assignment. This assignment was difficult to understand, so we worked together using Pair Programming, and some Test Driven Development on all parts of this assignment.

# Comments to Evaluators:
This contains tests for the Networking class. We manually tested a lot of it, but the tests helped us understand what was expecting to happen.

# Assignment Specific Topics
Nothing to note here, we wanted to do these tests so we understood this better.

# Consulted Peers:
Each other, and got a lot of information from Piazza and Lab.

# References:
