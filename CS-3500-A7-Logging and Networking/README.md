# Overview of the Chatbot functionality

This is a chatbot that demonstrates networking code between a client and a server.

On server startup, the server will listen on port 11000 for client connections. When a ChatClient connects, their info is passed to the server. The server recieves messages, and sends them back to the client applications.


# Partnership:

Rayyan and I pair programmed on the assignment. This assignment was difficult to understand, so we worked together using Pair Programming, and some Test Driven Development on all parts of this assignment.


# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Seven - Predicted Hours: 7             Actual Hours:  9  - ( Rayyan 4.5 and Tyler 4.5 )


# Overview of Estimates:
    This project was more complicated, and definately took longer than we expected. Networking was a new concept, and there was a lot that needed be handled that we didn't expect. We probably will get better at estimates as we learn the basics behind 
    certain aspects of software development, such as how networking works in more detail.

# Overview of Estimates:
    Testing was done very manually for a lot of this. We ended up creating a testing project so we could figure out the networking class. After we did that, things started to make sense. 
    Testing the connection was difficult because of the firewall, but when we got to the UI it seemed easier to understand.
