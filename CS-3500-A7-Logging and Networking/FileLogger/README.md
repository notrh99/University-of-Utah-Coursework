# Partnership:
Rayyan and I pair programmed on the assignment. This assignment was difficult to understand, so we worked together using Pair Programming, and some Test Driven Development on all parts of this assignment.

# Comments to Evaluators:
We branched this class to start, so we could figure out branching. The commit for this branch ended at: 4b6fce3085226c7978b5ffdd99192b63b3c73919

# Assignment Specific Topics
Logging is very complicated, and so is dependency injection.

# Consulted Peers:
We consulted with eachother, and the Lectures from the course.
