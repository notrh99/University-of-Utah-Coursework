# Partnership:
Rayyan and I pair programmed on the assignment. This assignment was difficult to understand, so we worked together using Pair Programming, and some Test Driven Development on all parts of this assignment.


# Comments to Evaluators:
The UI pieces and configuring the logging were different, but the networking was the more difficult part of the assignment.

# Assignment Specific Topics
UI was straightforwarding after we figured out how the Networking worked. 

# Consulted Peers:
Lab/Lectures.
