# Partnership:
Rayyan and I pair programmed on the assignment. This assignment was difficult to understand, so we worked together using Pair Programming, and some Test Driven Development on all parts of this assignment.

# Comments to Evaluators:
We're pretty sure we implemented the class correctly - but it was hard for us to weed out a lot of bugs because it was difficult to test stuff over a network, with a lot of connections at once.

We branched this class, but ultimately worked together on the assignment because it was complicated. The commit for this branch ended at: 85ba57368ab574d5920d7233da92efc61aaf8b85.


# Assignment Specific Topics
We watched for Race conditions, and believe we caught them all.
