# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program can compute arithmetic expressions using standard infix notation. 
Possible operator is *, -, *, and /. With using dependency graph, spreadsheet can identify and 
demostrate each cells/nodes relationship such that which cell is dependent on other cells. 
Future extensions could be such as GUI or special features of custom spreadsheet. Now Formula object 
stores expression and its evaluation. Depends on changing on dependency graph, Formula object can
evaluate more. Due to create Spreadsheet project, it construct the internal of Spreadsheet with using 
Formula and DependencyGraph libraries. We can access, add, replace cells by its name. Cell can contain
string, double, and Formula. Spreadsheet allows to read xml files and make spreadsheet. Now it is creating
a GUI. So user actually can see visualize of this spreadsheet and interact with it.
